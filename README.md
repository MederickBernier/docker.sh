# docker.sh
bash script for docker with projects

So this script is for docker on wsl, you set the .sh file next to the folder where you have stored all your projects,

in the script you will have to edit the basePath value for the name of your folder where you store your projects.

if you want you can use aliases with .bash_aliases you can add
alias doc='./docker.sh'

so you can use doc in the terminal to trigger the script and having it working, just follow the base instructions.

Instructions in english will be following soon.
